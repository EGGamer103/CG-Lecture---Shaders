# CG-Lecture---Shaders

Of the tasks that were provided on friday, the multi UV texture, the Wpos texture and the reflection texture have all been completed.

as for strengths, i have found understanding the basics of information to be generally simple and have had little issue resolving any errors I come across within my code, through comparison to the practice code. 
as of now, due to reliance on the practice code, I feel that I have only little understanding of the newest of concepts for the reflection shader. to that end, I will be making aan effort to further my understanding 
of this design so as to be fully prepared for the more complex use of shaders in later lectures.
